        <p>The second view of this page uses the FireBase Realtime Backend as a Service. I just recently became familiar with FireBase, but it has an immediate impact on the way I view web applications. Initially, I just thought NodeJS apps were a means to replace static HTML and provide a better user experience. I was always thinking of them from the standpoint of a developer who was building web pages for a firm, or company, etc. Now, I understand that web applications can include robust features that would be unnecessary  on a company website for promotional purposes. I realized that they are just like any other app, but just hosted on the world-wide-web. Additionally, this helped me understand why mobile frameworks such as Iconic are so popular today. Getting back to FireBase, It is no surprise that more than one hundred thousand people use it world wide. There are several libraries that have been developed to be used in correlation with FireBase. With the help of GeoFire, developers can easily popular a Maps view with Realtime data from their FireBase url. This ability to use live data has led to <a href=“https://www.firebase.com/docs/open-data/”>Maps that track bus locations, airport delays, and more</a>, and this pleased me greatly. Seeing this important data displayed in Realtime made me feel as though I could build a unique web application which people truly relied on and used! 
	In the next page, I utilize Angular to provide 3-way data binding with FireBase. Whereas in two-way data binding changes in model resulted in changes in view (and vice-versa), three-way data binding extends this functionality to the FireBase BaaS. In turn, the FireBase Backend synchronizes changes in data across all clients</div>
