        <p>
            I spent the last 12 months dedicated to learning the latest of web development. This was a result of my new found ability in the field, and I have became increasingly more infatuated with the development of web applications. Throughout the past year I went from learning JavaScript basics to developing node web applications with the help of only online resources. Therefore, I know my growth in knowledge will be tremendous when I am around a team of seasoned developers. Although I initially excelled in the styling aspect of development, I worked consistently to learn the latest in JavaScript development, and I can proudly say I am pleased with the results. My abilities have led me to receiving work as a freelance developer, but I canâ€™t stress enough my want to work with a team. Among other things, it is going to eliminate the countless hours I waste trying to resolve issues. That being said, it was the hours I spent digging through information that have molded me in to the developer I am today. Moreover, I believe the perseverance I have displayed during my time learning shows my thirst to learn the latest in web development. Simply put, I wish to work with a team that will make me the best developer I can possibly be</p>
