        <p>When I first began to focus on web development, it was no surprise that I was drawn into responsive design. Before studying development, I worked in graphic design which ultimately played quite a role in my love for programming. Specifcially, I was drawn to learning as much as I could about Sass CSS and responsive design. I quickly became acustomed with a multitude of grid frameworks. When writing Sass, I turned to the compass framework which I now use in every project I work on. Sass make styling applications easy, and it allows me to break down my stylesheets into different partials. These partials can then easily be reused in different projects with the help of variables. I still manage continue learning some of Sass' latest features, but it's evident that I spend the vast majority of my time studying full stack development. Nonetheless, I am confident in my abiity to style rapidly web applications, and definitely believe it is a great skill to possess.
